## Write a short comment describing this function

# The function cacheSolve: computes the inverse of the special matrix returned by the makeCacheMatrix.  

# If the inverse has already been calculated the function should skip the computation 
# and retrieve the inverse from the cache.

        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
